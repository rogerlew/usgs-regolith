Dependencies
============

Fortran
-------
The Fortran source code in this distribution can be compiled using freely available gfortran (http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) or any of the commercially available Fortran compilers that support Fortran 95 and Fortran 77.  A sample make file, which has been tested with the Linux operating system is included, but it might require editing in order to work on other platforms or with other compilers.

Python
------
Python scripts and notebooks included with this distribution have been developed using Python 3.6 and verified to run using Python 3.8. The scripts also use NumPy v1.14 or later.
